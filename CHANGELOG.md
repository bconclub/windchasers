## 2026-05-18 15:30 IST · ux(thank-you): minimal header — logo + Call + WhatsApp, no hamburger

`/thank-you` was falling through to the navbar's hamburger-menu branch because it wasn't in the `showCompact` list. After a form submission users don't need a nav drawer — they need a clean confirmation page.

- **`components/Navbar.tsx`** — added `isThankYou = pathname?.startsWith("/thank-you")` to the `showCompact` predicate. Same logo + Call + WhatsApp icon pair as the rest of the funnel pages, identical on mobile and desktop. No menu, no slide-out.
- Did **not** add /thank-you to `useWaCapture` — the WhatsApp pill on the thank-you page links directly to `wa.me` (no point capturing phone again right after they submit).

## 2026-05-18 15:00 IST · fix(pat-backup): auto-create the "PAT Backup" tab on first write

The dual-write safety net was failing in prod because the "PAT Backup" tab didn't exist in the Event Data 2026 spreadsheet yet — `/api/pat-backup` returned `Unable to parse range: 'PAT Backup'!A:V`. Combined with PROXe still down, every PAT lead was being lost.

- **`lib/sheets.ts`** — new `appendToSheetEnsuringTab()` wrapper. Tries to append; on a missing-tab error (regex match against `Unable to parse range`, `not found`, `No such sheet`, `sheet name`), calls `spreadsheets.batchUpdate.addSheet` to create the tab, then retries the append. Also tolerates `already exists` from a concurrent creation.
- **`app/api/pat-backup/route.ts`** — switched from `appendToSheet` to `appendToSheetEnsuringTab`. First successful submission after deploy will create the "PAT Backup" tab automatically.
- No manual sheet setup required anymore. Tab will exist after the first PAT submission in prod.

## 2026-05-18 14:30 IST · feat(pat): dual-write to PROXe + Sheets so a PROXe outage never costs us a PAT lead

PROXe's `/api/agent/leads/inbound` was returning `500 taskErr is not defined` for every PAT submission today. Confirmed via curl against prod `/api/leads` — every PAT lead during the outage was being lost. Fix: dual-write to both destinations and decouple the thank-you redirect from PROXe success.

- **`lib/sheets.ts`** — new `getPatBackupSheetTab()` helper. Default tab name `PAT Backup`; override with `GOOGLE_SHEET_TAB_PAT_BACKUP`.
- **`app/api/pat-backup/route.ts`** (new) — backup endpoint for PAT submissions. Writes 22 columns to the Event Data 2026 workbook:
  ```
  A Date  B Name  C Phone  D Email  E City  F Audience
  G Total  H Tier  I Qual  J Apt  K Read
  L Eligible 12th  M PROXe Status  N PROXe Lead ID  O Answers (JSON)
  P-V utm_source / utm_medium / utm_campaign / utm_term / utm_content
       / landing_page / referrer
  ```
- **`components/AssessmentForm.tsx`** — submit phase now fires `/api/leads` (PROXe) and `/api/pat-backup` (Sheets) **in parallel via `Promise.all`**. Both outcomes are logged.
  - **At least one succeeded** → user proceeds to `/thank-you?type=assessment` and sees their score.
  - **Both failed** (network down, both backends offline) → "Please check your connection and try again."
  - PROXe = system of record when healthy; Sheets = permanent safety net.

Need on the Sheet side:
- Create the **`PAT Backup`** tab in Event Data 2026 (`145KgARkFGEi4_hjwR5dN6Vv8NJlnmzHhX8I7wvNOc-w`).
- Optionally add column headers in row 1 — see the column layout above.
- Once PROXe is fixed and the outage row is reconciled, the team should treat Sheets-only rows (`PROXe Status = pending` or empty `Lead ID`) as leads to manually push into PROXe.

## 2026-05-18 14:00 IST · fix(api/leads): sanitize PROXe runtime errors before showing to user

PAT submissions were failing with the cryptic "taskErr is not defined" message because PROXe's backend was crashing and we were faithfully relaying their JS runtime error to the end user.

- **`app/api/leads/route.ts`** — when the upstream message matches a server-error shape (`is not defined`, `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, stack-trace fragments like `at func (`), we now log the raw message server-side and surface "We could not save your details just now. Please try again in a moment." to the user.
- Keeps the lead-loss visible (the request still fails with 502) so we know to investigate, but stops leaking PROXe's internals to candidates filling the PAT.

NOTE: this masks a real PROXe-side bug. The PROXe team needs to ship a fix for whatever's throwing `taskErr is not defined`. Until they do, leads from the affected window won't reach the CRM.

## 2026-05-18 13:45 IST · fix(wa-capture): drop duplicate "Hi WindChasers" greeting

The WhatsApp message was reading "Hi! I'm Thanzeel, Hi WindChasers, I'd like to..." because the modal already prepends "Hi! I'm {name}, " and each per-page template also started with "Hi WindChasers, ". Stripped the leading greeting from every template in `components/Navbar.tsx`. Final message now reads naturally: "Hi! I'm Thanzeel, I'd like to know more about pilot training."

## 2026-05-18 13:35 IST · feat(wa-capture): add name field back to WhatsApp modal

The sentinel `"WhatsApp Lead"` name in PROXe was hard to triage — every WA prelaunch row looked the same. Reintroduced a name input above the phone:

- **`components/WhatsAppCaptureModal.tsx`** — new name input (gold user icon, autocomplete=name, autofocus). Microcopy switched from "Phone only" to "Drop your details". Phone input no longer auto-focuses (name takes precedence).
- The captured name is now sent as the real `name` field in the PROXe payload (was `"WhatsApp Lead"` sentinel). Counsellors see the actual lead name in CRM rows.
- WhatsApp redirect message now pre-fills with `Hi! I'm {name}, {messageTemplate}` so the conversation opens with introduction context.
- Validation: name and phone both required; phone still needs ≥ 10 digits.

User-facing: modal asks for name + phone; submit composes `Hi! I'm <name>, I'd like to know more about ...` and opens WhatsApp.

## 2026-05-18 13:20 IST · fix(nz-seminar): May 29, 2026 is a Friday, not Saturday

Calendar check: 2026 starts on a Thursday; May 29 = day 149 of the year; 148 mod 7 = 1; Thursday + 1 = **Friday**. Every "Saturday"/"Sat" reference flipped to "Friday"/"Fri":

- `app/nz-seminar/page.tsx` — meta description, hero event-details row, "Secure Your Seat" subtitle
- `app/thank-you/page.tsx` — NZ seminar confirmation message, next-steps "add to calendar" line

User-facing: every place we tell users the seminar day now matches the actual calendar.

## 2026-05-18 13:10 IST · fix(proxe-widget): pin web agent to bottom-right

- **`app/globals.css`** — added `!important` left/right overrides on the PROXe widget container + launcher selectors. Default embed.js positions the widget bottom-left; new rules force `right: 16px` (mobile) / `right: 24px` (≥768px) and `left: auto`.
- Applies to every page that mounts the PROXe embed script (`/pilot-training`, `/dgca`, `/helicopter`, `/international`, `/agent`).
- Quick removal of clutter: matches the conventional chat-widget position so it doesn't collide with left-side content (sticky CTAs, footer links).

## 2026-05-18 12:50 IST · ux(wa-capture): premium redesign matching the open-house glass hero

Brand-native rebuild of the WhatsApp capture modal. Old version read as a generic SaaS popup; new version mirrors the open-house glass-hero language (gold corner accents, top gradient hairline, eyebrow with live pulse) so it feels native to the rest of the site.

What changed in **`components/WhatsAppCaptureModal.tsx`**:

- **Ambient gold glow halo** behind the card via a 520×420 `bg-[#C5A572]/8 blur-[100px]` orb. Hard to notice consciously, but it makes the dialog feel anchored on the page instead of floating.
- **Gold gradient hairline** along the top edge (`from-transparent via-[#C5A572] to-transparent`). Reuses the open-house hero treatment.
- **L-shaped corner accents** in gold at top-left and bottom-right corners (2px stroke, 20px reach). Same pattern as the open-house glass card.
- **Concierge eyebrow** "AVIATORS DESK · LIVE" with a pulsing green dot (same `animate-ping` pattern as the homepage "Admissions Open" status pill).
- **Headline upgraded** to 28px semibold with a subtle text-shadow for depth.
- **Phone input redesigned** as a single boarding-pass field with a fixed country-code chip ("+91" in gold + "IN" sublabel) on the left, then the number itself. Focus state lights up the border in gold + a soft 3px gold ring.
- **CTA button** still WhatsApp green, but with a Send icon, a hairline white inner highlight, a green-tinted lift shadow on hover, and an animated spinner during "Connecting…" state.
- **Trust strip** under the CTA: two gold checkmark inline-flags ("A real human replies" · "No marketing spam") separated by a thin divider.
- Body scroll is locked while the modal is open so the page can't sneak under.
- Backdrop bumped to `bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-md` for stronger focus.
- Modal width 440 → 480 to accommodate the richer layout without feeling cramped.

User-facing: tapping the WhatsApp pill in the navbar on `/`, `/pilot-training*`, `/dgca`, `/helicopter`, `/international` now opens a designed, on-brand modal instead of the generic dark box.

## 2026-05-18 12:30 IST · feat(wa-capture): all program pages route to marketing WA agent (98424)

- **`components/Navbar.tsx`** — every WA capture entry (home, pilot training, DGCA, helicopter, international) now redirects to `+91 90350 98424` (the marketing/automation agent). Previously DGCA, helicopter, international, and home went to `+91 95910 04043` (general support). All five program pages now hit the same automated funnel.
- Extracted the number into a `MARKETING_WA_AGENT` constant so it's a single point of change next time.

## 2026-05-18 12:20 IST · ux(wa-capture): inline phone input + button, centered on mobile

- **`components/WhatsAppCaptureModal.tsx`** — phone input and "Open WhatsApp" button now sit on the same row (input left, button right) instead of stacked. Modal width up from 360px to 440px to fit both comfortably.
- Mobile: modal is now centered (was sliding up from bottom). Same `items-center` everywhere.
- Title: "Start a chat" (was "Start a WhatsApp chat" from earlier).
- Button label shortens to "Opening..." while submitting so the inline layout doesn't reflow.

## 2026-05-18 12:00 IST · ux(wa-capture): phone-only modal + cleaner PROXe fields

Made the WA capture modal much smaller and stripped the name field — the conversation starts on WhatsApp anyway, so the name surfaces naturally there. Also restructured the PROXe payload so CRM rows show meaningful labels instead of `pilot_training_wa_prelaunch`.

UX:
- **`components/WhatsAppCaptureModal.tsx`** — phone-only single field. Max width `360px` (was `400px`). Compact 5-unit padding (was 6). Headline shrunk from `text-xl` to `text-base`. Added close X button top-right. Slides up from bottom on mobile (`items-end sm:items-center`). Auto-focuses phone on open. Submits on Enter.
- Phone validity check: requires ≥ 10 digits.
- Input style now follows the design system: `bg-[#0D0D0D] border border-[#333]` with gold focus ring + leading phone icon, matching ATC form style.
- CTA button: 11-unit height (was 12), keeps WhatsApp green with gold-tinted hover lift.

PROXe labels:
- `data.event_name` now sends `"WhatsApp Prelaunch"` (was snake_case like `pilot_training_wa_prelaunch`). This becomes the human-readable `notes` field in PROXe.
- `data.touchpoint` carries the per-page slug (`navbar_pilot_training`, `navbar_dgca`, etc.) for analytics filtering.
- `data.channel` = `"whatsapp"`.
- `data.program` = human-readable program name (`"Pilot Training"`, `"DGCA Ground Classes"`, `"Helicopter License"`, `"International Flying"`, `"Homepage"`).
- `data.page` = pathname only (e.g. `/pilot-training`) instead of full URL with query.
- Name no longer captured client-side; sentinel `"WhatsApp Lead"` is sent so PROXe's required-name field is satisfied. The real name surfaces in the WhatsApp chat itself.

## 2026-05-18 11:40 IST · feat(wa-capture): expand to all program pages

- **`components/Navbar.tsx`** — WA capture modal now triggered on `/`, `/pilot-training*`, `/dgca`, `/helicopter`, `/international` (was only `/pilot-training*`). Each page gets its own pre-filled message + PROXe source tag:
  - Home → `home_wa_prelaunch`, "I'd like to know more about Windchasers."
  - Pilot training → `pilot_training_wa_prelaunch`, "I'd like to know more about Windchasers' pilot training programs." (waNumber 919035098424)
  - DGCA → `dgca_wa_prelaunch`, "I'd like to know more about DGCA ground classes."
  - Helicopter → `helicopter_wa_prelaunch`, "I'd like to know more about the Helicopter Pilot License program."
  - International → `international_wa_prelaunch`, "I'd like to explore international pilot training options."
- Everything else (NZ seminar, webinars, ATC, cabin crew, summer camp, open house, students, parents, flight schools) keeps the existing direct `wa.me` anchor.

Verified each page renders the capture button via preview; NZ-seminar still uses the direct anchor.

## 2026-05-18 11:20 IST · feat(wa-capture): name+phone capture before WhatsApp on /pilot-training*

Stop losing the lead when a visitor taps WhatsApp without sending the message. The Navbar WA pill on `/pilot-training*` now opens a small modal asking for name + phone, fires the lead to PROXe (via `/api/leads`, type=event, event_name=`pilot_training_wa_prelaunch`), then redirects to wa.me with the name pre-filled into the message.

- **`components/WhatsAppCaptureModal.tsx`** (new) — reusable modal. Name + phone inputs, validates, fire-and-forget POST to `/api/leads`, then `wa.me` redirect with `Hi! I'm {name}, ...` message body.
- **`lib/attribution.ts`** (new) — first-touch UTM persistence in `localStorage` under `attr_utm_*` keys. Survives tab close and return visits, unlike the existing sessionStorage capture which only lasts the tab session.
- **`hooks/useTracking.ts`** — calls `captureAttributionToLocalStorage()` on first render alongside the existing sessionStorage capture. PAT and sheet forms unaffected (they still read sessionStorage).
- **`components/Navbar.tsx`** — on `/pilot-training*` the green WhatsApp pill is a `<button>` that opens the capture modal. Every other page still uses the direct `<a href="wa.me/...">` (no behavior change). WA business number for pilot training: `+91 90350 98424`.
- Lead is sent to existing PROXe `/api/leads` proxy as `type: "event"` with `data.event_name = "pilot_training_wa_prelaunch"` and full attribution (utm_*, page_url). No new API route or PROXe key exposure.

User-facing: tapping the WhatsApp icon in the navbar on `/pilot-training`, `/pilot-training-students`, `/pilot-training-parents` now opens a 2-field modal before going to WhatsApp.

## 2026-05-17 21:40 IST · fix(sheets): force INSERT_ROWS so new submissions never land shifted

- **`lib/sheets.ts`** — `appendToSheet()` now passes `insertDataOption: "INSERT_ROWS"` to Google Sheets. Previously the API used OVERWRITE mode with table detection: when a row had gap-columns mid-row (e.g. NZ-seminar's blank Stage/Remarks at I/J with attribution data at K-Q), the detector could anchor to the rightmost fragment and write the next submission starting at column P instead of column A.
- Fix is global. Every event form (open-house, nz-seminar, webinar, summercamp, cabin-crew, atc) now inserts cleanly below the last row, anchored to column A.
- Pre-existing misplaced rows in the sheet need to be deleted manually. New submissions from this point will align correctly.

## 2026-05-17 21:25 IST · copy: strip em dashes from thank-you and NZ-seminar content

Brand voice update. Em dashes removed everywhere they appeared in the thank-you flow and the NZ seminar page. Examples:
- thank-you: "You're registered for the NZ Seminar" (was "You're registered — NZ Seminar")
- thank-you next steps: "Watch your WhatsApp. We'll share venue details and a reminder" (was "Watch your WhatsApp — we'll share venue details and a reminder")
- nz-seminar walk-out card: "Private 1:1 conversations with school heads. Your questions, your child, your budget."
- nz-seminar speakers note: "More NZ flying school representatives joining the panel. Full list shared closer to the date."
- early-stage modal: split the dash-joined clauses into two sentences.
- below-12 back link: "I picked the wrong status, go back" (was a dash).
Also cleaned up internal code comments for consistency.

## 2026-05-17 21:15 IST · copy(nz-seminar): Anton role + page meta tags

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — Anton Ramenskiy role shortened to "Senior Manager" (was "Senior Marketing Manager").
- Page meta updated to match the latest hero copy:
  - `<title>` now leads with "Train where the world's best pilots train" + venue/date.
  - `<meta name="description">` rewritten to the new value prop: "Meet the New Zealand flight schools turning students into commercial pilots faster than anywhere else. Free in-person seminar, Bangalore, Sat May 29, 2026 · 3:00 PM. Only 30 seats."
  - `og:title` / `og:description` aligned with the new headline.
  - Added Twitter card meta so link unfurls render properly on X/Twitter too.

## 2026-05-17 21:05 IST · copy(nz-seminar): rewrite hero subtext

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — subtext now reads "Meet the New Zealand flight schools turning students into commercial pilots faster than anywhere else." (was "The fastest route from 12th to commercial pilot starts here."). Names the value prop and the country in one line.

## 2026-05-17 21:00 IST · fix(nz-seminar): hide sticky mobile CTA while hero CTA is on screen

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — sticky mobile "Secure Your Seat" no longer stacks on top of the hero CTA. New behavior:
  - Hero CTA on screen → sticky hidden
  - Scrolled past hero (>60% of viewport scrolled) → sticky shown
  - Register form's submit button on screen → sticky hidden again
- Implementation switched from two IntersectionObservers to a single scroll/resize handler measuring `window.scrollY` vs hero height and `registerRef.getBoundingClientRect()`. More reliable, no flash on first paint.

## 2026-05-17 20:50 IST · copy(nz-seminar): tighten hero headline + subtext

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — hero copy updated:
  - H1: "Train where the world's best **pilots train.**" (was "Train in the world's best country for flight training.")
  - Subtext: "The fastest route from 12th to commercial pilot starts here." (was the longer "Skip Google and Reddit…" line)

## 2026-05-17 20:40 IST · feat(nz-seminar): redirect modal fires on Below/Pursuing select + dropdown reordered

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — Current Status dropdown reordered ascending by stage: Below 12th → Pursuing 12th → Completed 12th → Graduate or above.
- Selecting "Below 12th" or "Pursuing 12th" now triggers the redirect modal **immediately** on change (was submit-time). Users don't waste effort filling the form when we know they need a different flow.
- Blocked panel converted from an inline form replacement to a true centered modal (fixed inset-0, z-100, backdrop blur). Has "Get the early-stage roadmap" + "Chat on WhatsApp" + a "go back, I picked wrong" escape hatch.
- Form alignment now stays clean because the modal floats above instead of swapping body content.

## 2026-05-17 20:15 IST · fix(nz-seminar): remove eligibility note + route Pursuing 12th to early path too

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — removed the inline eligibility note above the form (too noisy). Form now stands clean.
- The status dropdown now routes both `Pursuing 12th` AND `Below 12th` to the early-stage path (was only Below 12th). The seminar's value prop is what-after-12th, so anyone still in school gets a better experience on `/assessment/early`.
- Updated the blocked-state copy: "We have a better fit for you" instead of "This seminar isn't the right fit yet" — friendlier framing, no judgment.

## 2026-05-17 19:55 IST · feat(nz-seminar): eligibility note + dedicated below-12 path

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — added a visible eligibility note above the form: "This seminar is for students who have completed or are currently in 12th. Below 12th? See our early-stage path →" with an inline link to `/assessment/early`.
- When a student selects "Below 12th" and submits, the blocked state now shows a thoughtful message ("This seminar isn't the right fit yet — you have time to plan properly") plus two big CTAs: `Get the early-stage roadmap` (→ `/assessment/early`) and `Chat with us on WhatsApp` (pre-filled message). Auto-redirect target switched from `/` to `/assessment/early` and the timer is now 6s so users can read and click.

## 2026-05-17 19:35 IST · feat(nz-seminar): wire form submissions to "29 NZ Webinar Confirms" tab

- **`lib/sheets.ts`** — `getNzSeminarSheetTab()` default tab is now `29 NZ Webinar Confirms` (matches the actual tab name in Event Data 2026). Was a placeholder `NZ Seminar` before.
- **`app/api/nz-seminar/route.ts`** — pinned to Event Data 2026 spreadsheet (`145KgARkFGEi4_hjwR5dN6Vv8NJlnmzHhX8I7wvNOc-w`) explicitly so no env misconfig sends leads elsewhere. Override still possible via `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_NZ_SEMINAR` or `EVENT_DATA_2026_SHEET_ID`.
- Column layout updated to match the existing sheet: row writes A Date, B Type, C Name, D Phone, E Email, F City, G With +1, H Current Status, I Stage (blank — counsellor fills), J Remarks (blank — counsellor fills), K-Q utm_source / utm_medium / utm_campaign / utm_term / utm_content / landing_page / referrer. Range expanded `A:O` → `A:Q`.

## 2026-05-17 19:20 IST · fix(nz-seminar): swap biggest-mistakes card image to brand-supplied Indian-family photo

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — replaced stock Unsplash (Surface, father + 2 toddlers) with the user-supplied `/nz-seminar/Parent image.webp` (80KB). On-brief: Indian parents + adult student matching the target audience.

## 2026-05-17 19:05 IST · feat(nz-seminar): use NZ landscape AVIF as hero + consolidate assets under /public/nz-seminar/

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — replaced the generic Vimeo aviation iframe with a static `/nz-seminar/NEw Zealand.avif` (138KB) rendered via `next/image priority`. NZ-specific, no external dependency. Darkened overlays to `0.65 / 0.30` so the glass-morphism card stays readable on the new bg.
- **`public/nz-seminar/`** — assets moved here from `public/webinar/` (Irene King.png, Antony.png, takeoff.mp4) so all NZ-page imagery sits in one folder. Speaker headshot paths in the page updated accordingly.
- Cleaned up the now-unused `heroInView` destructure.

## 2026-05-17 18:50 IST · fix(nz-seminar): topic cards now read as actual cards

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — root cause: card bg `#1A1A1A` matched the section bg, so the card had no visible container. Changes:
  - Card bg lifted to `#1F1F1F` with a `border border-white/10` all the way around + `rounded-2xl` + `shadow-lg shadow-black/30`. Now sits clearly on the `#1A1A1A` section.
  - Hover: subtle `border-[#C5A572]/60` + gold-tinted shadow + `-translate-y-1` + 5% image zoom.
  - Icon moved off the awkward gap between image and text — now a 44px circular badge floating over the top-left of the image (`bg-[#1F1F1F]/85 backdrop-blur-sm`). Image and copy now read as one cohesive card.
  - Gradient overlay updated to fade to the new card bg.

## 2026-05-17 18:30 IST · feat(nz-seminar): wire speaker headshots

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — Irene King and Anton Ramenskiy speaker cards now show real headshots instead of initials fallback. Sourced from existing `/public/webinar/` assets (Irene King.png · 60KB, Antony.png · 46KB).

## 2026-05-16 22:15 IST · feat(pat): display PAT result as score/100 instead of score/150

- **`app/thank-you/page.tsx`** — the big PAT score panel now renders `Math.round(score × 100 / 150)/100` instead of `score/150`. Examples: 150 → 100/100, 120 → 80/100, 90 → 60/100.
- Internal scoring (`PAT_MAX_TOTAL = 150`), the PROXe `total_score` payload, and tier thresholds (premium ≥140, strong ≥120, moderate ≥90) all remain on the original 150 scale. Historical leads stay comparable; only the user-facing display changes.
- User-facing: PAT result reads as a more intuitive percentage.

## 2026-05-16 21:30 IST · feat(attribution): persist first-touch UTMs through every form, write them to all sheet tabs

- **`hooks/useTracking.ts`** — `utmParams` returned by the hook now reads from sessionStorage (`getStoredUTMParams`) instead of the current URL. So a user landing with `?utm_source=fb&utm_campaign=nz-may-26` and clicking through to /open-house, /nz-seminar, /atc still sends the original campaign attribution.
- **`lib/sheets.ts`** — new `extractAttributionCells(data)` helper. Returns a stable 7-cell array `[utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_content, landing_page, referrer]` to append to every form's sheet row.
- **`app/api/open-house/route.ts`** — range A:H → A:O. Appends 7 UTM/landing/referrer cells.
- **`app/api/nz-seminar/route.ts`** — range A:H → A:O. Same.
- **`app/api/webinar/route.ts`** — range A:I → A:P.
- **`app/api/summercamp/route.ts`** — range A:I → A:P.
- **`app/api/cabin-crew/route.ts`** — range A:I → A:P.
- **`app/api/atc/route.ts`** — range A1:I1 → A1:P1.
- **`app/cabin-crew/page.client.tsx`** + **`app/summercamp/page.tsx`** — now read stored UTMs/landing/referrer at submit time and include them in the POST body. (Open House, NZ Seminar, ATC already submitted `utmParams` via `useTracking` — now those values are first-touch instead of current-URL.)
- User-facing: no UI change. Sheet-side: rows now show campaign attribution. Verified locally that UTMs persist across page navigation and reach the API payload.

## 2026-05-16 21:00 IST · feat(nz-seminar): add "Meet the speakers" section

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — new section between "You'll spend lakhs..." and "What we'll cover" featuring Irene King (CEO, Ardmore Flying School) and Anton Ramenskiy (Sr. Marketing Manager, Auckland International Pilot Academy). Cards show name, role, school in a horizontal layout with a gold-bordered avatar. Falls back to initials (IK / AR) when no headshot file is present.
- **`public/team-nz/README.md`** — placeholder folder + instructions for dropping the two JPG headshots. Wiring auto-picks them up once present.
- Reordered section backgrounds so alternating `#131313 / #1A1A1A` is preserved after the insertion.

## 2026-05-16 20:40 IST · fix(nz-seminar): swap "biggest mistakes" card image to an affluent family

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — replaced the "Biggest mistakes families make" card photo. Old shot (Frederick Shaw) read as a village family — wrong audience signal. New shot (Surface) shows a father and two kids at a laptop, which matches the target audience (families planning ₹1cr+ flight training spends).
- **`public/unsplash/family-decision-OaD5um45.jpg`** — new 71KB photo.
- **`public/unsplash/family-decision-LfqvVFSo.jpg`** — removed.
- **`public/unsplash/_credits.json`** — credit swapped.

## 2026-05-16 20:15 IST · feat(nz-seminar): add Unsplash imagery to topic cards

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — each of the 6 "What we'll cover" cards now leads with a 16:9 hero image (NZ mountains, cockpit training, financial planning, flight instructor, airline pilot, family decision-making). Icon sits below the image with the existing title + description.
- **`public/unsplash/*.jpg`** — 6 new photos (52–124 KB each, served via `next/image`).
- **`public/unsplash/_credits.json`** — credits appended for the 6 new NZ-seminar photos.
- **`scripts/unsplash-fetch.mjs`** — reusable script that searches Unsplash, downloads at `w=900&q=72`, and updates the credits ledger.
- User-facing: NZ seminar topic cards now have rich imagery instead of just icons.

## 2026-05-16 19:30 IST · feat(nz-seminar): new New Zealand flight training seminar landing page

- **`app/nz-seminar/page.tsx`** — new landing page for the May 29, 2026 NZ Flight Training Seminar in Bangalore. Mirrors `/open-house` structure (glass-morphism hero with NZ flag accent, topics covered, walk-out-with section, who-should-attend, registration form, sticky mobile CTA). Copy is tailored to NZ flying schools, CPL roadmap, and cost transparency.
- **`app/api/nz-seminar/route.ts`** — new POST endpoint that appends seat registrations to the "NZ Seminar" Google Sheet tab (overridable via `GOOGLE_SHEET_TAB_NZ_SEMINAR`).
- **`lib/sheets.ts`** — added `getNzSeminarSheetTab()` helper.
- **`app/thank-you/page.tsx`** — added `nz-seminar` form type: meta-lead tracking, doc title, registration summary card with WhatsApp CTA, and secondary "NZ Seminar details" link. Imported `Plane` icon.
- **`components/Navbar.tsx`** — `/nz-seminar` triggers compact header (logo + Call + WhatsApp), with NZ-specific WhatsApp prefill text.
- User-facing: new public route at `/nz-seminar` where ad traffic lands to book a seat. Form posts to the new sheet tab so leads don't mix with Open House.

## 2026-05-15 · fix(mobile): restore vertical page scroll when touching carousels

- **Root cause**: `touchAction: "pan-x"` on Framer Motion drag elements tells the browser to handle x-panning natively and block y — vertical page scroll dies when a finger lands on any carousel.
- **Correct value**: `touchAction: "pan-y"` — browser handles vertical scroll natively, Framer Motion gets horizontal drag events.
- **`components/VideoCarousel.tsx`** — mobile `motion.div` drag: `pan-x` → `pan-y`
- **`components/WhyChooseUsCarousel.tsx`** — card stack `motion.div` drag: `pan-x` → `pan-y`
- **`components/ImageCarousel.tsx`** — mobile `motion.div` drag: `pan-x` → `pan-y`
- **`components/StudentsFlyingGallery.tsx`** — native CSS scroll container: removed `touch-pan-x` class, replaced with `style={{ touchAction: "pan-x pan-y" }}` so both directions are explicitly allowed.
- User-facing: touching any carousel card no longer traps vertical page scroll on mobile.

## 2026-05-15 · fix(pixel): sessionStorage dedup for Lead event

- **`app/thank-you/page.tsx`** — replaced `useRef` dedup with `sessionStorage` key (`wc_lead_sent:<type>:<search>`). Survives Suspense re-mounts (each mount shares the same sessionStorage), so Lead fires exactly once even when Next.js mounts `ThankYouContent` twice during hydration.
- Removed unused `leadSentRef` and `useRef` import.
- User-facing: no UI change. Pixel Helper should now show exactly 1 Lead per form submission.

## 2026-05-15 · fix(pixel): eliminate double PageView and double Lead events

- **`components/MetaPixelInit.tsx`** — new client component owns `fbq('init')` and `fbq('track', 'PageView')`. `useRef` guarantees `init` fires exactly once per session; `PageView` fires on every pathname change (correct SPA behaviour).
- **`app/layout.tsx`** — inline pixel script now only sets up the fbq queue (IIFE). Removed `fbq('init')`, `fbq('track', 'PageView')`, redundant `__wcFbqInited` flag, and `<noscript>` img fallback that Pixel Helper counted as a second PageView.
- **`app/thank-you/page.tsx`** — replaced window-based dedup Set with `useRef` flag (`leadSentRef`). Ref is tied to the component instance, making it impossible to fire Lead twice in the same page load.
- User-facing: no UI change. Pixel Helper should now show exactly 1 PageView per page and 1 Lead per form submission.

## 2026-05-14 · fix(pilot-training): make sticky demo CTA button visible

- User-facing: "Book a Demo Class" sticky button is now a high-contrast solid gold pill, impossible to miss on scroll

## 2026-05-14 · feat: track last-visited program to pre-fill BookingForm interest

- `lib/sessionStorage.ts`: Added `lastVisitedProgram?: string` to `UserSessionData` interface and exported `setLastVisitedProgram(program)` helper that writes to session storage
- `app/dgca/page.tsx`: Calls `setLastVisitedProgram("dgca_ground")` on mount
- `app/helicopter/page.tsx`: Calls `setLastVisitedProgram("helicopter_license")` on mount
- `app/international/page.tsx`: Calls `setLastVisitedProgram("pilot_training_abroad")` on mount
- `app/pilot-training/page.tsx`: Calls `setLastVisitedProgram("pilot_training_abroad")` on mount
- `components/BookingForm.tsx`: Refactored `mapSourceToInterest` to handle direct `InterestSource` values; added fallback that reads `lastVisitedProgram` from session when no URL `source`/`prefill` param is present
- User-facing: BookingForm interest field now auto-selects the correct program when a visitor navigates from a program page without a URL source param
